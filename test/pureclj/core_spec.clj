[[:chapter {:title "Introduction"}]]
"Like other LISPs, Clojure is an imperative functional programming language.
In many ways, Clojure has made strides towards 'purity', such as intensive use
of purely-functional data structures, but in other areas, such as Java interop,
Clojure is as imperative as Java.
While imperative programming is commonplace, with only few esoteric programming languages
taking the purely-declarative path, it has some disadvantages."

"pureclj is an attempt to create a purely-functional dialect of Clojure.
This is a stripped-down Clojure, with only the purely-functional parts, including:
- Functions (well dah...)
- `let`, `loop`, `if` etc.
- maps, sets, vectors and lists
- A subset of the `clojure.core` library functions and macros, as well as
- `clojure.string`, `clojure.set` and potentially other pure libraries.

It does not include:
- Variables
- Atoms, refs, agents, etc.
- Java interop
- Imperative functions from `clojure.core`"

"The `symbols` function is the key in our static analysis.  It takes a s-expression,

"`loop` is supported similarly."
